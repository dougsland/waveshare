    def set_motor_pid(self, p_coefficient, i_coefficient, d_coefficient, windup_limit=255):
        """
        Configure the motor PID values.

        What is PID Control?
        PID control is like having a robot "driver" that continuously checks if the motor is doing
        what it’s supposed to and makes corrections to keep it on track.

        For example:

        You want the motor to spin at 50 RPM, but due to friction or other factors, it’s spinning at 45 RPM.
        A PID controller adjusts the motor's power to get it back to 50 RPM.


        Args:
            p_coefficient (int): Proportional coefficient.
            i_coefficient (int): Integral coefficient.
            d_coefficient (int): Differential coefficient.
            windup_limit (int): Windup limit for the PID controller (default: 255).

        p_coefficient (Proportional coefficient):
            This controls how strongly the system reacts to the current error.
                If the motor is 10 RPM too slow, the proportional term says, "Let me add more power to fix it right now."
                The larger the p_coefficient, the stronger the reaction. But if it’s too large, the system might 
                overreact and cause instability (e.g., oscillating speeds).

        i_coefficient (Integral coefficient):
            This looks at the history of the error over time and tries to fix any lingering issues.
            For example, if the motor has been consistently 2 RPM too slow, the integral term will keep track of this
            "cumulative error" and gradually adjust the power to eliminate it.
            The larger the i_coefficient, the more strongly the controller tries to correct long-term errors.
            However, if it’s too large, it may cause the system to overcompensate, leading to instability.

        d_coefficient (Derivative coefficient):
            This predicts how the error is changing and adjusts to prevent overshooting or instability.
            For example, if the motor is speeding up too fast and might overshoot the target RPM, the derivative
            term will slow it down slightly. The larger the d_coefficient, the more cautious the controller is
            about rapid changes. If it’s too large, the system may become too sluggish and fail to respond quickly to changes.

        windup_limit (Windup limit for the PID controller):
            The windup limit prevents the integral term from accumulating too much error over time.
            Why is this important? If the motor is stuck and can’t move for some reason, the integral term might keep "remembering"
            the large error and increase the power endlessly. This is called integral windup, and it can make the system unstable.
            The windup_limit sets a cap on how much correction the integral term can apply, ensuring the system stays stable.

            Default Value:
                The default value is 255, meaning the maximum allowed correction is limited to 255.

        Returns:
            str: Response from the rover.
