# Waveshare Car Devices Support Module

## Overview

This repository provides a **generic Python module** designed to support Waveshare devices, particularly for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and remote-controlled robotics projects. The module simplifies integration, control, and operation of vehicles by offering features like joystick-based driving, Wi-Fi connectivity, and motor speed control.

Tested devices include:

- **Waveshare UGV Rover Open-Source 6 Wheels 4WD AI Robot, Compatible with Raspberry Pi 5, Dual Controllers, Comes with Pan-Tilt Module, PI5-4GB Included**  
- [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D2L27JDT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Features

- **Joystick-Based Control**:
  - Use any standard joystick or game controller to drive the vehicle.

- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**:
  - Easily connect to and control the vehicle via Wi-Fi.

- **Motor Speed Normalization**:
  - Smooth and accurate motor speed adjustments for stable navigation.

- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Works on Raspberry Pi OS and other Linux-based distributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Hardware**:
   - Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) with one of the supported Waveshare adapters.
   - A compatible joystick or game controller.
   - A vehicle chassis with motor drivers connected to the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Software**:
   - Python 3.x.
   - Required libraries installed (see below).

## Example: Joystick-Controlled UGV

The following example demonstrates how to use the module to control a UGV using a joystick and Wi-Fi:

```python
import pygame
from FOSS import BaseUGVController
from time import sleep

# Instantiate the controller with default parameters
ugv_controller = BaseUGVController(
    ssid="UGV",             # Default Wifi
    password="12345678",    # Default Pass
    ip="192.168.4.1",       # Default IP for the Rover
    interface_name="wlan0"  # Your device interface name
)

# Connect to Wi-Fi
ugv_controller.connect_to_wifi()

# Initialize pygame and joystick
pygame.init()
pygame.joystick.init()

# Ensure a joystick is connected
if pygame.joystick.get_count() == 0:
    print("No joystick detected. Please connect a joystick.")
    pygame.quit()
    exit()

# Get the first joystick
joystick = pygame.joystick.Joystick(0)
joystick.init()
print(f"Joystick detected: {joystick.get_name()}")

# Control loop
try:
    print("Use the joystick to control the UGV.")
    print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

    while True:
        # Process events
        pygame.event.pump()

        # Get joystick axis values
        axis_forward_back = joystick.get_axis(1)  # Forward/Backward
        axis_left_right = joystick.get_axis(0)   # Left/Right

        # Map axis values to speeds
        forward_speed = -axis_forward_back  # Invert to match UGV forward
        turn_speed = axis_left_right

        # Calculate motor speeds
        left_speed = forward_speed + turn_speed
        right_speed = forward_speed - turn_speed

        # Normalize speeds if necessary
        max_speed = max(abs(left_speed), abs(right_speed), 1.0)
        left_speed /= max_speed
        right_speed /= max_speed

        # Command the UGV
        ugv_controller.move(left_speed=left_speed, right_speed=right_speed)

        # Delay to avoid spamming commands
        sleep(0.1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nStopping the UGV...")
    ugv_controller.move(left_speed=0, right_speed=0)
    print("UGV stopped. Exiting.")
finally:
    pygame.quit()
```
